# Statistics

Application of computational statistics models to predict clinical outcomes for patients with severe bleeding from trauma, in order to inform clinical decision making in the hospital setting.

Traumatic injuries can produce both acute and more chronic consequences that lead to permanent disabilities, increase long-term mortality and reduced life expectancy. Patient attributes, injury characteristics and treatment interventions are the key factors in determining short-term survival and clinical outcomes of the patient.

The aim of this project is to apply machine learning algorithms to predict clinical outcomes for patients with severe bleeding from trauma, in order to inform clinical decision making in the hospital setting. In particular, we seek to build a classification model that will identify whether a patient is likely to make full recovery, require care and rehabilitation or at risk of dying. Intention of the project is identify patients who will become dependent after their injury and will require extensive care and patients who may not survive in the course of treatment. This will assist hospitals to organize appropriate rehabilitation and counselling resources for the patient and their kin in a timely manner. The project will compare the results of several classification approaches including Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbour, Support Vector Machines, Bagging and Linear Models(Multinomial and Ordinal) to find the optimal model to predict results.

DATASET DESCRIPTION
This project presents the analysis of the CRASH-2 (Clinical Randomisation of an Antifibrinolytic in Significant Haemorrhage) study data. The CRASH-2 consists of 20,207 adult trauma patients with, or at risk of significant bleeding who were generally within 8 hours of injury.
